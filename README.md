Virtual Classroom Manager
The Virtual Classroom Manager is a terminal-based application designed to handle virtual classroom operations, such as class scheduling, student attendance, and assignment submissions.
This project demonstrates the use of best practices, SOLID design principles, and appropriate design patterns in Java.

Features
Classroom Management:
Add, list, and remove virtual classrooms.

Student Management:
Enroll students into classrooms and list students in each classroom.

Assignment Management:
Schedule assignments for classrooms and allow students to submit them.

Design Principles and Patterns
SOLID Principles:
Single Responsibility Principle: Each class has a single responsibility.
Open/Closed Principle: Classes are open for extension but closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution Principle: Subclasses can be used in place of base classes without affecting the correctness.
Interface Segregation Principle: Interfaces are specific to client needs.
Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules but on abstractions.

Design Patterns:
Repository Pattern: Used for managing data storage and retrieval.
Factory Pattern: Could be used for creating instances of entities based on more complex scenarios.
Adapter Pattern: Can be introduced for integrating different data sources or external systems.
